# Challenge3

 Update Data from Form Input using React Hooks (useState)

## How it works 

You can get a render of the result on this link https://codesandbox.io/s/challenge-3-use-react-state-to-update-dom-starter-1uzw7?file=/src/index.js

You can also clone the project on your editor. Follow these steps :
1. Clone the project by using `git clone`
2. Open your terminal, move inside the project and run `npm install`. Wait until all packages are installed.
3. Then, in your terminal use `npm run start`. The browser will open and you'll see name and age change whenever you change the input.
